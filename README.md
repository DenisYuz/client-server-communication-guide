# Complete Guide To Client Server Communication

A complete list of all the ways a Client and Server communicate with each other in JavaScript and Node. â€” Edit

Every time we initiate an HTTP or an XMLHttpRequest, a long-lived Server-Sent Events or WebSocket session, or open a WebRTC connection, we are interacting with some or all of these underlying services.

There is no one best protocol or API. Every nontrivial application will require a mix of different transports based on a variety of requirements: interaction with the browser cache, protocol overhead, message latency, reliability, type of data transfer, and more. Some protocols may offer low-latency delivery (e.g., Server-Sent Events, WebSocket), but may not meet other critical criteria, such as the ability to leverage the browser cache or support efficient binary transfers in all cases.
